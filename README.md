# Welcome to GoChat!

Welcome to the chat that smiles back :)
We are excited to introduce GoChat which based on the founder's names, Gili and Ofek.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Easy to use
First, you have to download the project to your local device. Then, In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


You can sign up in the register page. Also, you have hard-coded users you can login with them.
To see hard-coded chat with text, photos, video and records you can login with Ofek's user:

Username - ofekyaloz
Password - 234567

You can see there a chat with Gili and Omer (Adam). When you add a new friend you have to click on button in the top-left side and put in his username. Then, a new chat conversation will add to your chat-box but with his nickname.
